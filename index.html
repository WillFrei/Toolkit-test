				<h1>Target Weight Toolkit</h1>
				<p>The food industry has specific, measurable needs, but poultry doesn't always grow on that schedule. This can result in real business losses: at best, excess production and over consumption of feed - at worst, the inability to supply demand resulting in upset customers and damaged reputation. Target Weight Toolkit provides you more accurate bird weights and growth predictions so you can meet the specifications and demands of your customers.</p>
